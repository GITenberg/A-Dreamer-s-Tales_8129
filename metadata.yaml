description: "A Dreamer's Tales is the fifth book by Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany,\
  \ considered a major influence on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien, H. P. Lovecraft,\
  \ Ursula K. Le Guin and others. It was first published in hardcover by George Allen\
  \ & Sons in September, 1910, and has been reprinted a number of times since. Issued\
  \ by the Modern Library in a combined edition with The Sword of Welleran and Other\
  \ Stories as A Dreamer's Tales and Other Stories in 1917.\nThe book is actually\
  \ Dunsany's fourth major work, as his preceding book, The Fortress Unvanquishable,\
  \ Save for Sacnoth (March, 1910), was a chapbook reprinting a single story from\
  \ his earlier collection The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories (October, 1908).\n\
  In common with most of Dunsany's early books, A Dreamer's Tales is a collection\
  \ of fantasy short stories.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
